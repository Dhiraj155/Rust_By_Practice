//In Rust, many of the operators can be overloaded via traits. That is, some operators can be used to accomplish different tasks based on their input arguments. This is possible because operators are syntactic sugar for method calls. For example, the + operator in a + b calls the add method (as in a.add(b)). This add method is part of the Add trait. Hence, the + operator can be used by any implementor of the Add trait


use std::ops;

// Implement fn multiply to make the code work.
// As mentiond above, `+` needs `T` to implement `std::ops::Add` Trait.
// So, what about `*`?  You can find the answer here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ops/

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(6, multiply(2u8, 3u8));
